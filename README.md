The file index.php is reading the test.xlsx file to send mail using the smtp host.  

All the mention parameter are taken from the excel file
1. SMTP HOST
2. SMTP USERNAME
3. SMTP PASSWORD
4. SMTP PORT
5. From Address
6. To Address(array with comma separated)
7. CC Address(array with comma separated)
8. Bcc Address(array with comma separated)
9. Attachment File.


You can add multiple new row with all the information and the php script will be running in the loop to send mail row wise. 

Thanks.
